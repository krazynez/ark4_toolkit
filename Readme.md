### Krazy Toolkit

- Just a bunch of the tools I have forked or created from scratch.
- Think of it as an All-in-one Krazy Shop _for all your PSP Needs_

__Projects include:__

- [X] PSP Tool

- [X] UMDRescue

- [X] UMDRescue (1.50 kxploit )

- [X] Wallpaper Dumper

- [X] Theme Dumper

- [X] ChronoSwitch

Credits:
- raing3 for PSP Tool to reference as I made both PSP Tool 1.69 and this for vlf lib

- Dark_AleX for vlf lib which provides the nice visuals.

- Spiritfader UMDRescue who I initially worked with ( where did ya go my friend? )

- Ass.... I mean __*cough cough*__ Acid_Snake for libpspexploit used for both Wallpaper & Theme dumper. ( hurry up and find me! )

- Davee and TheZett for amazing work of ChronoSwitch has been fun adding to it and more to come for sure. Damn GO always causing issues.

- Total Kommando for Icons and giving me this inital idea ( though was slightly different from what you expected it to be )
